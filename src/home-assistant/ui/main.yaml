# Bootstrap for my Lovelace UI configuration.
# It loads all resources for Lovelace dynamically from sub-folders
#
# Views are actually included one by one, this is in order to preserve
#  the order of the tabs of the view in the UI

# Example
#  https://github.com/SeLLeRoNe/HA-Config/blob/master/ui-lovelace.yaml
mode: yaml
resources:
  # - url:
