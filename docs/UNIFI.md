# Unifi network setup

Wow this could have been a lot easier... so first of all I would recommend
resetting all old devices. This could have saved me one of many headaches.

## Equipment

Wall Outlet -> UPS -> PDU -> Other equipment

- [Eaton - 5S UPS](https://amzn.to/3OdcxzE)
- [Unifi - Toolless Server Rack](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/all-accessories/products/toolless-mini-rack)
- [Unifi - Power Distribution Professional](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/all-power-tech/products/usp-pdu-pro)
- [Unifi - Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/all-switching/products/udm-pro)
- [Unifi - U6-Lite](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/all-wifi/products/u6-lite)
- [Unifi - U6+](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/all-wifi/products/u6-plus)

## Setup

I followed the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbo94CW6Ano)
on how to plugin the PDU to my Dream Machine. Once I got that up and running
and the Dream machine was able to talk outside to the internet I was ready to
get wired up.

## Update

Do as many updates as you can, even the new equipment had a lot of updates I
needed to get through. The first priority is to get the Dream Machine Pro updated.
This held me back as it didn't recognize my access points and thought I was doing
something wrong!
