# Welcome to my Smart Home! ü§ñ

Welcome to my home üè†... well kind of.

Wait, what's a smart home?! I'm so new at this what does this all mean?? Check out my [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)

## What is this repo?

This is a mono-repository that has EVERYTHING related to my smart home. This was my [previous attempt](https://github.com/ZinkNotTheMetal/HomeAssistant/tree/master). But here's where I take everything I've learned üß† and put it into this attempt repository.

-   [My Home Assistant Configuration](src/home-assistant/)
-   [My ESP Home Configuration](src/esphome/)
-   [My Node Red Configuration](src/node-red/)
-   [Device List](docs/DEVICES.md)

The benefit of this structure is that it allows me to keep all of the files that I need in one location. If I add anything into my smart-home I have one place to go. I see quite a few other Git repositories that only have their home assistant configuration but I feel like that's a bit limiting when there are more parts you need to keep track of.

### Who am I?? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

By trade I am a software developer, so I am constantly curious on how to setup things using best practices and conventions. I am creating this project using the concept of the source `src/` directory.

This is my üè† Home Assistant configuration & documentation for my Smart Home. Be sure to ‚≠ê it for support. Updated FREQUENTLY!
