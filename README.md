# Welcome to my Smart Home! ü§ñ

Welcome to my home üè°, well digitally of course!

Wait, what's a digital smart home?! I'm so new at this what does this all mean??
Check out my [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)

In a nutshell this is my [Home Assistant](https://home-assitant.io) configuration
for my smart home. Be sure to ‚≠ê it for support. Updated FREQUENTLY!

## What is this repo?

This is a mono-repository that has EVERYTHING related to my smart home.
This was my [previous attempt](https://github.com/ZinkNotTheMetal/HomeAssistant/tree/master).
But here's where I take everything I've learned üß† and put it into this attempt repository.

- [My Home Assistant Configuration](src/home-assistant/)
- [My ESP Home Configuration](src/esphome/)
- [My Node Red Configuration](src/node-red/)
- [Device List](docs/DEVICES.md)

I chose this project structure so that I can keep all the files in one repository.
This allows me to keep track of Node-Red / ESP Home / Home Assistant configurations.
This allows me also to have one place to track all issues or TODO items for integrations
as well as automations. I found several other repositories that are separated out
which is okay if you prefer that way too! Just another opinion here in GitHub

### Who am I?? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

By trade I am a software developer who prides myself on best practices and
learning new things. I try to keep this balance in my own projects.
