Once I moved in I wired the downstairs closet to be a server closet.
There are two panels in the house for accessing internet.
The first is in the laundry room / mud room. This is where it was located when
the house was built.
It had only 4 ethernet ports wired for the entire house (listed below).
After I moved in I installed the second access panel underneath the stairs closet.
Go all the way in the back and go to the left.
You will notice power and a white box that is similar to the laundry room.
That has all ethernet ports wired in one location. You will need to get an
ethernet cord to wire up the #24 port and the #1 port if you want to go
back to the laundry room panel.

### Ethernet port numbers and what they mean Port numbers

#### Laundry room

1. ONT (from frontier into your home)
2. Flex (we don't think this cable is still with us)
3. Family room
4. Master bedroom

#### Server closet / underneath the stairs

1. ONT (feeds into laundry room panel)
2. Flex (feeds into laundry room panel) - that then routes to the flex room
3. Family room (feeds into laundry room panel) - that then routes to the family room
4. Master bedroom (feeds into laundry room panel) - that then routes to the
master bedroom
5. Office Access point - feeds to the access point to give the office wifi
6. Breakfast Room / Nook Access point - feeds to the access point directly to
give the breakfast room wi-fi
7. Upstairs access point - feeds to the access point directly to give the
breakfast room wi-fi
8. Patio access point - feeds to the access point directly to give the
outside patio wi-fi
9. Point to point - wired the back of the house for a point to point device to
be able to give the dock wi-fi access. This is located in the master bedroom
window (right one) if you look up and to the right
10. TV - wired to the back of the Television in the living room
11. Sound bar - wired to the back of the soundbar located below the television
12. Front door camera - wired for the ability to add a front door camera in front
of the front door
13. Driveway camera - located looking up and to the right of the garage there
is a brown plug that will pull down for ethernet.
Future proofing to add cameras later
14. Patio camera - located close to the patio access point there is a place to
put an exterior camera
15. Back yard camera
16. Doorbell - the newer cameras are powered by Ethernet and for this reason
I wanted to get it installed into the rack. If you provide power over ethernet (PoE)
it will provide power to the doorbell.
If you chose not to go this option you can install the brown wires back into the
new doorbell from the blue cable and that will use the existing chime and power
your device.

17-23 not used

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 - Disabling as I want the #24 number as 17-23 -->
24. ONT (from frontier into your home)

## Pest Control

Each home in the neighborhood has a proprietary system installed by HomeTeam Pest
defense. This system allows HomeTeam to hookup to some internal hoses into the home
to get pests out more effectively. I would recommend doing them but you are open
to exploring other options if you would like.

* Phone Number: 727-530-9493

### Roller Shades and drapes

Purchased from 3-day blinds
Automated shades are currently battery operated and each shade uses 8 AA batteries

### Irrigation Water pump

The pressure side of the pump actually sends water back to the intake in an effort
to self clean it.
It is important to point out, water in Tarpon Springs is expensive especially if
itâ€™s used for irrigation.
Lakefront homeowners do not discuss that we pump from the lake to other neighbors
since they do not have the ability, not having lake access.
Should you have any questions,
your neighbor Kevin Laine has the same configuration for the pump,
irrigation and dock (including lift and wiring).
All the lakefront homeowners use pumps for lawn watering only.
Waterworld Irrigation has worked on the irrigation, lake intake and replaced with
brand new filter last month.

### Water Cutoff

Both of the following are located where the utilities are between 1440 and 1436

1. Water Shutoff to house - First Red Knob
2. Fresh water to dock - Second Red Knob

### Boat Lift

* Rated: 4500 lbs
* Power required: 220V

Mechanism:
The lift mechanism is simple, cables are wrapped around a 2" piece of pipe that
is controlled by an electric motor.
The lift was purchased through `Lifts 4 Less` and self installed by previous owners.

*NOTE*: This power is shared as the same circuit as the pump. The reasoning here
is that one would not operate both at the same time.

### Dock

There is a light and electrical outlet (110v) on the dock, fresh water at the dock.
All wiring and the water lines
(fresh water and water for lawn) run on the underside of the dock in approved
conduit.
Everything related to the dock and electrical was permitted,
inspected and approved per previous owners installation.

### Air Conditioning

Filters are located in the AC room closet upstairs
